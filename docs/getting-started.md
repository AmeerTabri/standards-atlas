In order to get started, you will need a working installation of [doorstop](https://github.com/doorstop-dev/doorstop) on your computer. Follow the [instructions and documentation](https://doorstop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and you will be ready to go in no time.

Next you probably want to clone this repo to work with it.

With a bit of further reading in the doorstop documentation, it becomes clear that the tool itself works a great deal with git. To avoid nested git repositories, the content generated by the Standards Atlas should be kept in a separate directory from the Standards Atlas. This can be, for example, a project in which the standards are to be used as a reference for the specific requirements.

The main tool is located under tools/standards-atlas.
To get started you can just run it with the following command:
```sh
$ ./tools/standards-atlas
```
This will create the whole standards-atlas doorstop files under **/tmp/standards-atlas**
You can change this by running the script with the parameter **"-d"**

Usage:
```sh
$ ./tools/standards-atlas --help


```
