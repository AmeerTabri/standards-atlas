# standards-atlas
The Standards Atlas enables orientation and shared travel in the otherwise walled-off world of international norms and standards.

This is a first attempt, a research project in which one such journey, the transferability of safety cases from the context of one standard to another is to be investigated.

The choice of [doorstop](https://doorstop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) as a tool for this purpose is pragmatic and arbitrary. The tool is suitable for the first step of generating a structure with which the standard documents can be mapped without replicating their content. The yaml data format is simple and flexible enough to be converted into other formats later if necessary. Specifically, this could be [StrictDoc](https://strictdoc.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), for example, or perhaps a requirements extension of SPDX with corresponding tooling that is currently under development.
