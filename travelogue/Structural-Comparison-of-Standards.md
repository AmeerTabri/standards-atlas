# The basic structure: life cycle, management, process model

The standard documents on functional safety for electrical, electronic and programmable electronic systems in the various technology domains have IEC 61508 as a common basic standard. Therefore, a structural similarity can be recognized in the standards of different domains.

The standards describe the procedure for planning and managing the entire life cycle of a programmable electronic system in the context of functional safety. Based on the basic standard, the structurally related parts of other standards are identified below.

The process models described by the standards for the development of functionally safe E/E/PE systems have one thing in common: they all consider a system in a specific context. It is about a specific application with a specific hazard potential and risks, for which there are assessments and suitable safety functions are designed, developed, validated and maintained to manage the risks.

The use of a software safety element out of context (ISO 26262-10 9), the Proven in Use argument or the use of existing software (EN 50657 6.2) are special cases that are only dealt with in passing.

However, for the purpose of transferring software from the automotive sector to the rail transport domain, this is exactly what is required.

# Reuse of software

Even the structural comparison of common concepts between the standards shows that the respective perspectives and focal points differ to a greater or lesser extent depending on the domain.

The approaches in the respective standards towards the reuse of existing software are structurally difficult to compare. The relevant sections of various standards are identified below and, where possible, compared with other standards.

## Proven in Use Argument

Reusing something that has proven to be safe, reliable and resilient in practice is intuitively an obvious approach.

- IEC 61508-2:2010 7.4.10 describes this route as "Route 2s".
- EN 50126-2:2017 8.3.2 allows the use of a tried and tested system as a reference.
- ISO 26262-8:2018 14 deals with the PiU argument in detail.

In certification practice, the PiU argument for a detached software element has not yet been used. This approach meets with fundamental rejection.

## Qualification of Software

In contrast to the PiU, in which the proven object is taken as a black box, existing documents from a life cycle and development process structured according to possibly different rules in a different context are used in the qualification of existing software with the aim of obtaining equivalent statements and assurances for the existing software in the new context.

- IEC 61508-3:2010 7.12 describes this route as "Route 3s"
- EN 50129:2018 6.2 deals with "Use of pre-existing items"
- ISO 26262-8:2018 12 deals in detail with the qualification of software

For the automotive industry, ISO 26262 requires the unchanged adoption into the new application context for the qualification of software. Only the PAS 8926 supplement for ISO 26262 makes the continuous patching of software, which is already necessary for cyber security and firmly established for Linux, for example, also possible for the qualification of software.

The extent to which the wording in the Cenelec standards restricts the qualification of software to unmodified adoption in a similar way to ISO 26262 has yet to be clarified.
